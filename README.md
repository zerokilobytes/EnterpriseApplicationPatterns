    1.1 Domain Model
        A domain model represents an object in the context of the business domain. It organizes business logic into well defined domain entities (Classes) 
        that contain both behavior and data. It creates a hierarchy of inter connected domain objects that interact with each other by invoking methods on 
        each other.
